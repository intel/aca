# Analysis Communication Agent Reference Solution 

## Introduction
Analysis Communication Agent enables performance analysis of custom embedded operating systems (OS) or real-time operating systems (RTOS) and the applications running on them using Intel<sup>速</sup> VTune<sup>TM</sup> Profiler. This reference implementation provides guidance on enabling a sampling collector for this purpose. 

## What is Intel<sup>速</sup> VTune Profiler?
Intel<sup>速</sup> VTune<sup>TM</sup> Profiler is a performance analysis tool that can be used to profile and optimize application performance. For more information, please check [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/vtune).

## Supported OS Platforms
This reference solutuon is implemented for Linux operating system. However, you can implement the Analysis Communication Agent and the sampling driver for any embedded operating system compatible with Intel<sup>速</sup> VTune<sup>TM</sup> Profiler for data collection and visualization.

## Supported Hardware Platforms
The reference solution works on any of the recent Intel hardware platforms.
