Validated on python 2.7

Usage:
    Target platform preparation.
        Build test target application
        > cd ./apps/target
        > make
        > cd -

        Copy target application to the target
        > scp ./apps/target/test user@target

        Start application on target with number of cores specified (8 in the example)
        > ssh user@target "./test -nt 8"

        The application will give output like this:
        > nt = 8
        > dataSize = 0x10000
        > Hotspot ip: 400AD1 : 4197073
        > numberOfThreads = 8

    Configuration:
        The configuration file is located in ./config.py
        You need to change it according you target machine. For example

        def ApolloLakePremiumSKU(self):
            self.cores_number = 8               # Number of cores the platform have
            self.testapp = 'test'               # Name of test application. On some platforms may be used full path of application
            self.testapp_hotspot_ip = 0x400AD1  # The ip take from target application
            self.protocol_version = 6           # Internal protocol version

    Testing:
        Form directory with test run:
        > python test.py 127.0.0.1 ApolloLakePremiumSKU

        Where the configuration type is the same as in config.py
